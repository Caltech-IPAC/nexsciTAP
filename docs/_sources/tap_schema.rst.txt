Setting up Your TAP_SCHEMA Tables
=================================

The TAP specification requires that you maintain in your database a set of tables
describing your holdings, as described on section 4 of the TAP specification (http://ivoa.net/documents/TAP/20190927/REC-TAP-1.1.html#tth_sEc4).  TAP specifies the structure of these tables:

- They have fixed names (like TABLES and COLUMNS);

- They contain a minimum set of columns with fixed names (like COLUMN_NAME);

- They must reside in a separate DBMS "schema" named TAP_SCHEMA.

Such fixed scheme aids data mining; a user can issue a set of canned queries
against your database to determine your holdings and they can find columns 
by their function, such as coordinates.

The NExScI TAP service makes use of the TAP_SCHEMA tables to inform the 
presentation of data.  In particular, if you want fine control over the 
formatting of output, you can add a FORMAT column to the COLUMNS table
and populate it with C/Python format strings like "6d" to get six-digit
integers or "20s" for twenty-character strings.
