Installation Instructions
=========================

Beforehand
----------
You will need Python 3.6 or later. We recommend using the Anaconda distribution.

nexsciTAP takes advantage of Python Database API Specification v2.0 (DB API v2.0) (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#introduction), which offers a consistent API across Python modules that access databases. You will need to "pip install" the DB API 2.0 adapter associated your DBMS
(*e.g.* cx_Oracle for Oracle, sqlite for SQLite3, *etc.*).  If you forget Python will inform you what is missing when you  try to run the code.


Quickstart
----------

If you are using a web server that supports 
CGI programs, such as Apache or NGINX, you can do a "pip install"::

    pip install nexsciTAP

then create a Python executable in your "/cgi-bin" directory tree, wherever
you have that set up (e.g. .../cgi-bin/TAP/nph-tap.py under Apache)::

    /bin/env python

    from TAP import tap

    tap.main()

Before nexsciTAP can operate as a server, you will have to configure it. The next section covers this. 

Not-so-Quick Start
------------------
Rather than pip install nexsciTAP (which pulls along a couple of other 
packages), you can build them yourself from source in GitHub.

The three GitHub packages you will need are:

- `nexsciTAP`_,
- `ADQL`_, and
- `SpatialIndex`_


Once you have these downloaded, you can run the standard::

   python setup.py bdist_wheel

command for each package and then "pip install" the wheel file this builds in 
the ./dist subdirectory.  This gets us to the same place as the "pip install" in the
Quickstart.  We still have to add the same CGI program and configuration file.
