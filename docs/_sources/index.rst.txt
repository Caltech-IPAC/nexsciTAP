What is nexsciTAP?
-------------------
Tabular data in astronomy (and other sciences) are commonly housed in relational
databases.  These may be final reduced data like astronomical catalogs, or searchable
metadata for image or spectra.  Research projects very often start with database 
searches of these tables, often followed by the download of associated data files.

The International Virtual Astronomy Alliance (IVOA) Table Access Protocol (TAP) Version 1.1, August 2019 
(http://http://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/20190927/REC-TAP-1.1.pdf)
provides a standard interface specification for such queries.  TAP defines 
* how
to compose the request using ADQL (http://www.ivoa.net/documents/ADQL/20180112/PR-ADQL-2.1-20180112.pdf), 
a dialect of the standard Structured Query
Language (SQL);
* how to submit the request to a remote server (either in foreground
or, for slow queries, in background); and 
* how to retrieve results when they are 
ready.

The NExScI TAP service is an Open Source (BSD 3-clause license) Python implementation of the protocol. Version 1.0 supports Oracle and SQlite3, ad we show how to extend to other DataBase Management Systems (DBMS).

Because queries against spatial regions on the sky are so common in astronomy, 
ADQL extends SQL with standard spatial constraint functions.  NExScI TAP includes a formalism for supporting 
fast spatially-indexed searches which requires no modification of the underlying DBMS.


Structure of this Documentation
-------------------------------
NExScI TAP supports operations of all scales, from a single table to the largest mission archives.

This documentation describes how to get started quickly. It covers:
* Installation and configuration;
* TAP operations and the structure
of the service; 
* Technical specifications of the spatial indexing and the 
translation of ADQL into the SQL understood by the local DBMS. 

All sections are written as stand-alone documents.
