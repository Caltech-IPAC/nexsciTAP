The nexsciTAP service allows remote users to make SQL database queries against a table or tables loaded into any supported DMBS.  However, the user (and the TAP service itself) rely on a collection of additional tables (in a group called "TAP_SCHEMA") to know what tables exist, what columns the tables have (including descriptive text and formatting information) and, in appropriate, what columns in the tables can be used as foreign keys for table joins.

Most of the information in the TAP_SCHEMA needs to be entered by someone cognizant of the data; there is no way around this.  But actually setting of the tables correctly and loading this data can be a bit of a chore.  To aid in this, we have developed a simple Python program that configures TAP_SCHEMA for one of our projects and can serve as a starting point for anyone who has to do the same for theirs.  There are several directions one can go with this and we would be happy to extend it if there is enough interest but we expect it is best used as a starting point for local efforts.
