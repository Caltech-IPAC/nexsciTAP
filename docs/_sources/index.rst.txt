What is nexsciTAP?
======================
Tabular data in astronomy are commonly housed in relational databases.  These may be final reduced data like astronomical catalogs, or searchable
metadata for image or spectra.  Research projects very often start with database 
searches of these tables, often followed by the download of associated data files.

The International Virtual Astronomy Alliance (IVOA) Table Access Protocol (TAP) Version 1.1, August 2019  (http://http://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/20190927/REC-TAP-1.1.pdf)
provides a standard interface specification for such queries.  Because queries against spatial regions on the sky are so common in astronomy, ADQL extends SQL with geometrical spatial constraint functions.

TAP defines 
* how
to compose the request using ADQL (http://www.ivoa.net/documents/ADQL/20180112/PR-ADQL-2.1-20180112.pdf), 
a dialect of the standard Structured Query
Language (SQL);
* how to submit the request to a remote DBMS server, either in the foreground
or, for slow queries, in the background; and 
* how to retrieve results when they are 
ready.

nexsciTAP is an Open Source (BSD 3-clause license) Python implementation of the protocol, developed at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI) at Caltech/IPAC. Version 1.0 supports Oracle and SQlite3, and we show how to extend the service to other DataBase Management Systems (DBMS). It includes a formalism for supporting  fast spatially-indexed searches which requires no modification of the underlying DBMS.


Structure of this Documentation
-------------------------------
NExScI TAP supports operations of all scales, from a single table to the largest mission archives.

This documentation describes how to get started quickly. It covers:
* Installation and configuration;
* TAP operations and the structure
of the service; 
* Technical specifications of the spatial indexing and the 
translation of ADQL into the SQL understood by the local DBMS. 

All sections are written as stand-alone documents.
